How to clean up the project file and keep the files in proper structure??


1) Make a folder called "routes" and keep all the courses endpoints in courses.js, authors endpoints in authors.js files.
2) Make router object in each file using the express module      express.Router()
3) Later these router objects can be used inside the main project file.
4) Each router objects will take care of requests related to specific endpoints.
   example:- All "/api/courses/" related endpoints will be taken care by "course router" object.
5)
