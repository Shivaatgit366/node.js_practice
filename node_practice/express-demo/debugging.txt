how to use "debug package" in the place of "console.log" statements?? we can use debug package so that things are clearly visible.


1) Instead of console.log statements, we can use debug package with environment variables.
2) Install debug package and make an object/function with it. Remember to give the required namespace.
3) Set environment variable to namespace   export DEBUG=app:startup     or    export DEBUG=app*
4) When we run the application, we can see debugging messages.
