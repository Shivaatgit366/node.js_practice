how to store configuaration settings in different environments and how to modify them.


"config" package should be installed.
Make a "config" folder and add "default.json", "development.json", "production.json" files into it. Add few lines of settings in them.
Make a "custom-environment-variables.json" file for password related settings. Keep it inside "config" folder.
Make an object using "config" module.
Everytime change the environment using "set" or "export" keyword.
Use "get" method to get the properties of "config" object what we have created.
Set the password in environment variable. Then config object can use "get" method to get the password.
